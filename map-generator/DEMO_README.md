# US Map Generator Demo

This is a standalone demo of the US Map Generator that allows you to create interactive US maps with your data and embed them on any website, including Shopify.

## How to Use

1. Open `combined-demo.html` in your web browser
2. Upload your data file (CSV or Excel) with state codes and values
3. Customize the map appearance
4. Copy the embed code to use on your website

## Files Included

- `combined-demo.html` - The main demo application
- `combined-demo.js` - JavaScript code for the demo
- `embed.html` - The embeddable map page
- `sample-data.csv` - Sample data for testing

## Data Format

Your data file should include:

- A column for state codes (e.g., NY, CA) or state names (e.g., New York, California)
- A column for values

Example CSV format:
```
State,Value
NY,100
CA,85
TX,75
```

## Embedding in Shopify

To embed the map in your Shopify store:

1. Go to your Shopify admin panel
2. Navigate to Online Store > Themes
3. Click "Edit HTML/CSS"
4. Find the template where you want to add the map
5. Add a new section or edit an existing one
6. Paste the embed code generated by the tool
7. Save changes

The embed code will look like this:
```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-domain.com/embed.html?id=1234567890" 
  width="100%" 
  height="500" 
  style="border: none; max-width: 100%;" 
  title="US Map" 
  allow="fullscreen">
</iframe>
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Map doesn't load**: Make sure you're using a modern browser with JavaScript enabled
- **Data doesn't appear**: Check that your data file has the correct format with state codes/names and values
- **Embed doesn't work**: Ensure the embed URL is accessible from your Shopify store

## Browser Compatibility

This demo works best in modern browsers:
- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 60+
